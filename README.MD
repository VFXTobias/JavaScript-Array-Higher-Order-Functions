Welcome!

This project was created to help explain JavaScript Array methods (filter, map, sort, and reduce) in a way that is simple and easy to digest.  Approaches using ES5 and ES6 (arrow functions) are shown and explained. I created this to help myself as I learn but thought it could be useful to others.  The content is derived from the Traversy Media coverage of the topic which I've found to be very helpful. 

You are welcome to fork this code and modify at your will.  

Regards,

Tobias Steiner
